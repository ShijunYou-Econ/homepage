    abstract: The Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program, established in 1997 through the Drug-Free Communities Act, aims to mitigate substance use among youth. This study examines the impacts of the DFC granting on juveniles in the United States from 2008 to 2019. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) model exploiting the staggered grant allocation to communities, we find that the DFC grants significantly curtail juvenile drug-related criminal activities. The potential mechanisms include reductions in marijuana use and opioid-related inpatient stays and improved academic performance among juveniles. In the auxiliary analysis, we also find positive impacts of DFC grants on reducing juvenile property crime and drug-related mortality. This study, to our knowledge, marks the first attempt to causally identify the impacts of DFCs on community well-being. Our comprehensive evaluation offers insights into the significance of collective community action in combating substance use, particularly amid the recent opioid crisis.

    abstract: Housing instability and drug misuse are two of the United States’ most pressing challenges, each bearing profound health and societal consequences. A crucial yet largely underexplored question is the extent to which the opioid crisis has intensified housing instability. Our study ventures into this relatively uncharted nexus, investigating how the OxyContin reformulation, a pivotal moment in the U.S. opioid epidemic, impacted eviction rates. Employing a dose-response Difference-in-Differences model and analyzing eviction data from 2004 to 2016, we demonstrate that the OxyContin reformulation precipitated a significant increase in evictions, especially in areas with weak eviction protections or limited access to psychiatric treatment resources. Channel analyses reveal increased marijuana initiation and heightened mental and physical health issues following the reformulation. Moreover, the OxyContin reformulation leads to greater reliance on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, signaling an escalated financial strain on governmental resources. Finally, we find evidence of increased marital disruption post-reformulation. Our findings underscore the urgent need for collaborative efforts between public health and housing authorities to address both the opioid and housing crises.

    abstract: Recent debate about raising federal minimum wage to $15 per hour receives substantial public attention. Yet the minimum wage literature has been
focusing on the labor market outcomes, with the health implications rarely being discussed. This paper investigates the impact of minimum wage increases on multiple dimensions of cigarette smoking behaviors for the low‐skilled population using the Current Population Survey‐Tobacco Use Supplement over a long time period (1998–2015). Results show that a $1 increase in the minimum wage raises the prevalence of smoking by about 2.3% and reduces cessation by about 13.7% among the low‐skilled workers. With further examinations, we find evidence of an income effect as one potential mechanism that leads to more smoking. The impacts on all low‐skilled adults, however, are somewhat smaller, which are most likely driven by the null effects among those who are out of the labor force. We additionally conduct a series of sensitivity tests and confirm the robustness of these results.

    abstract: 无形资本对企业创新和经济增长具有重要作用。准确地度量各类无形资本、更好地解释无形资本对企业行为和宏观经济发展的影响，也成为经济学研究的前沿问题之一。本文系统梳理国外宏观金融领域涉及无形资本的相关文献和最新研究进展，重点介绍各类无形资本的相关定义及其度量方式，从微观企业和宏观经济两个视角对已有文献进行归纳总结和深入分析。在微观影响方面，现有研究主要从无形资本对企业投融资、生产率水平及市场资产定价等角度进行分析。在宏观视角方面，现有文献主要聚焦于无形资本对经济增长核算、短期经济波动、市场结构变化等方面的影响。本文最后对未来研究方向进行评述与展望，同时也为落实我国企业科技创新的主体地位提供了政策启示。
